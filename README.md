# RethinkAI — Build Repository

This repository contains the public CI/CD pipeline that builds and releases
[RethinkAI](https://github.com/ai-hermes/wechat-mem0) — a cross-platform
Electron desktop application that brings persistent AI memory to your daily
workflow.

> **Note:** Application source code lives in the private repository
> [`ai-hermes/wechat-mem0`](https://github.com/ai-hermes/wechat-mem0).
> This repo exists solely to produce signed, notarized installers and publish
> them as GitHub Releases.

## Overview

RethinkAI is an AI-powered desktop assistant that integrates long-term memory
(via [Mem0](https://mem0.ai)) with large language models, web search
([Tavily](https://tavily.com)), and analytics
([PostHog](https://posthog.com)).  The build pipeline in this repository:

1. Creates a source tag and source release in `ai-hermes/wechat-mem0` (manual stable release flow).
2. Checks out the private source repository by tag.
3. Bumps the version to match the release tag.
4. Installs dependencies and resolves platform-native packages.
5. Builds platform-specific Electron installers.
6. Signs and notarizes macOS binaries using Apple Developer credentials.
7. Uploads all artifacts to a GitHub Release in this build repository.

## Releases

| Channel | Trigger | Tag |
|---------|---------|-----|
| **Stable (recommended)** | `workflow_dispatch` with `version` + `source_branch` | `v1.2.3` |
| **Stable (legacy)** | Push of a `v*.*.*` tag | `v1.2.3` |
| **Nightly** | Scheduled daily at 04:00 CST (UTC 20:00) | `nightly` |

Download the latest installer from the
[Releases](../../releases/latest) page.

## Single-Repo Stable Release Flow

Use only this repository (`ai-hermes/wechat-mem0-build`) to publish a stable release:

1. Open **Actions → Build Private Repository → Run workflow**.
2. Set:
   - `version`: target tag like `v1.2.3`
   - `source_branch`: source branch in `ai-hermes/wechat-mem0` (default `main`)
3. Run workflow.

What the workflow does:

1. Resolves the latest commit on `source_branch` in `ai-hermes/wechat-mem0`.
2. Fails fast if `version` already exists in `ai-hermes/wechat-mem0`.
3. Creates the same tag and auto-generated release in `ai-hermes/wechat-mem0`.
4. Builds installers from that exact source tag.
5. Publishes release `version` in `ai-hermes/wechat-mem0-build` with auto-generated notes and artifacts.

## Build Matrix

| Platform | Runner | Output |
|----------|--------|--------|
| macOS | `macos-latest` | `.dmg`, `.zip` |
| Windows | `windows-latest` | `.exe`, `.blockmap` |

Linux builds are prepared but currently disabled in the matrix.

## CI/CD Workflow

The single workflow file
[`.github/workflows/build_private_repo.yml`](.github/workflows/build_private_repo.yml)
drives everything.

```
manual stable dispatch / tag push / schedule
        │
        ├── manual stable dispatch:
        │     create tag + release in ai-hermes/wechat-mem0
        │
        │
        ▼
Checkout ai-hermes/wechat-mem0 by resolved ref/tag (via PRIVATE_REPO_PAT)
        │
        ▼
Setup Node 22 + npm ci
        │
        ├── macOS ──► npm run build:mac  ──► sign & notarize ──► .dmg / .zip
        │
        └── Windows ► npm run build:win ──────────────────────► .exe
        │
        ▼
softprops/action-gh-release  →  GitHub Release
```

On a **nightly** run, existing release assets are cleaned up before uploading
fresh ones so the `nightly` tag always points to today's build.
